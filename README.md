# RAG Experiments Playground

Some short and fun experiments with SOTA-style RAG pipelines, combined with hands-on learning and architectural exploration.
This repository is focused on reproducing large-scale RAG architectures in a simplified and experimental form. The main goal is to explore how modern retrieval techniques, stateless services, and composable pipelines behave when combined together.
The project is intentionally a work in progress and serves as a sandbox for testing ideas, patterns, and benchmarks rather than a production-ready system.

## Scope

- Stateless RAG-oriented architecture inspired by large-scale systems
- Experiments with modern retrieval combinations such as vector search, BM25, and structured document ingestion
- Focus on composability, reproducibility, and architectural clarity

## Current Direction

- Implement and test SOTA-style RAG pipelines
- Explore hybrid retrieval strategies combining dense and sparse methods
- Keep services stateless where possible to reflect scalable production patterns

## Planned Work

- Add and evaluate benchmarks such as T^2-RAGBench
- Introduce an optional continuous GraphRAG workflow inspired by tools like zepgraph
- Add deep research style pipelines and agentic search approaches
- Compare different pipeline compositions and retrieval strategies

## Status

- Work in progress
- Experimental by design
- Architecture and components may change frequently

## Disclaimer

This repository is primarily for research, learning, and experimentation. Expect incomplete features, refactors, and breaking changes as new ideas are tested.
